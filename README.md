What is Parkinson’s Disease?
●Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervoussystem affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India.This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorderaffecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

What is XGBoost?
●XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed andperformance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting andis based on decision trees. In this project, we will import theXGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of thescikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.
